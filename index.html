			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Water’s anomalous expansion upon freezing is a fascinating phenomenon that 
				has sparked interest in various fields. This document presents a novel heat 
				engine concept that leverages the anomalous expansion of water upon freezing. 
				This innovative approach has the potential to convert low-quality dissipated 
				heat energy into useful work, challenging the fundamental limits imposed by 
				Carnot’s theorem. It implies, quality of energy can be spontaneously improved.

			<h2>Abstract</h2>	
			<p>
				At standard conditions (0°C and 1 atm), water expands by approximately 9% when 
				transitioning from liquid to solid state. Moreover, when water is spatially constrained,
				upon freezing, it exhibits a remarkable pressure increase up to 220 MPa before it
				becomes another form of ice. Notably, increased pressure further lowers the melting 
				point, thereby amplifying the expansion. In other words, the expansion becomes even 
				more significant due to the reduction in melting point caused by the increased pressure.
				For instance, at a pressure of 200 MPa, water freezes at about 253 Kelvin and undergoes 
				a remarkable 16.8% expansion.
