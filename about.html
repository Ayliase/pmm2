        <p>The author, with a mechanical engineering background, has always been fascinated by the second law of
            thermodynamics (SLT) and its explanation of the time arrow. As a science enthusiast, this interest only grew
            stronger over time. </p>
        <p>However, a visit to a jail for a day profoundly impacted him, and he realized that psychological poverty is
            the root of all evil. Recognizing the energy industry's massive scale, he began exploring ways to harness
            energy from dissipated atmospheric heat, which could potentially alleviate humanity's dependence on supply
            chains and fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the efficiency limit imposed by Carnot's theorem posed a significant
            challenge. </p>
        <p>Determined to find a solution, he approached Prof. S.R. Kajale, the head of the mechanical engineering
            department at COEP (College of Engineering, Pune), about further research on the subject. Despite the
            controversy surrounding it, Prof. Kajale encouraged him to enroll in a PhD program under his guidance at
            Pune University. </p>
        <p>Tragically, Prof. Kajale passed away prematurely due to a heart attack, leaving the author heartbroken and
            uninterested in pursuing the PhD. However, he continued to think about converting atmospheric heat into
            useful work. </p>
        <p>In 2023, the author stumbled upon a research paper titled "Utilize Freezing Water to Generate Energy" by Dr.
            Mohamad Kharseh, which gave him a new insight into addressing the issue.</p>
